Atlas Cocktail Menu App - Project Context

Project Overview
This project is working on a cocktail menu web application.

• Repo: https://github.com/efarmiga/Atlas/tree/main(https://github.com/efarmiga/Atlas/tree/main)

• Live App URL: https://efarmiga.github.io/Atlas/Atlas_Cocktail_Menu.html

• Google Drive Folder (Reference): https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1-VVfkC8905ZxPBvaT7zrGiIaXct3WmTn?usp=drive_link

Constraints & Future Plans
• Current Constraint: We are not using `index.html` at this time. The app must be accessed via the specific Live App URL provided above.

• Future: Eventually, I might create more apps/pages in this project and at that time can create `index.html` as a single landing page.

How to use local repo:
Local repo files stored in /Atlas folder
Start web server from terminal:  python3 -m http.server 8000
View in browser:  http://localhost:8000
